## Brewery Application - Requirements & Proposal


## Project Requirements:

Your project should fulfill the following requirements:

Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Use at least two server-side APIs.

Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

Be responsive.

Have a polished UI.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.


## Proposal

What are you going to build and what problem does it solve?<br/>
(1)A brewery locator app that finds a local brewery based on set parameters.<br/>
(2) Rating system <br/>
(3) Based on user selection of image or description catagorize list by  "beer_style": (untapped API)

What APIs do you plan to use? Remember to look for free APIs with strong documentation that do not require CORS<br/>

What CSS library or framework do you plan to use?<br/>

How are you going to assign tasks and roles to team members?<br/>
By subsets of HTML, CSS, JavaScript issues.

Include a quick wireframe for your application. Note that while this will likely change once you get into building the project, having a clear idea of where to start 
will help your team get things rolling in the right direction more quickly.<br/>
