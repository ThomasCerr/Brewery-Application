## Brewery Application


## Project Requirements:

Your project should fulfill the following requirements:

Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Use at least two server-side APIs.

Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

Be responsive.

Have a polished UI.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.


## Proposal

What are you going to build and what problem does it solve?<br/>
A brewery locator app that finds a local brewery based on set parameters. It will also educate the user with random beer facts.

What APIs do you plan to use? Remember to look for free APIs with strong documentation that do not require CORS

What CSS library or framework do you plan to use?
https://get.foundation/

How are you going to assign tasks and roles to team members?
By subsets of HTML, CSS, JavaScript issues.

Include a quick wireframe for your application. Note that while this will likely change once you get into building the project, having a clear idea of where to start 
will help your team get things rolling in the right direction more quickly.
